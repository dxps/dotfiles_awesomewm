## My setup for AwesomeWM & XFCE

Basically, what I customized to my liking into:

- `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua` file
- `~/.themes`
- `~/.icons/` - configured in XFCE's _Appearance_

XFCE specific settings can easily be accessed using `modkey` (Win key by default) + `p` and type _settings manager_ to get it.

### Theme (Appearance)

Using `NumixSolarizedDarkCyan.EW` theme, which is a minor flavor of existing and already great [NumixSolarizedDarkCyan](https://github.com/Ferdi265/numix-solarized-gtk-theme).

### Icons

Using `Material-Black-Pistachio-Suru` icon theme to be placed into `~/.icons/` directory.

### Colors

- `#2BD4C0` as terminal (lxterminal or terminator) foreground
