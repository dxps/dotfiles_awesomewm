## My setup for AwesomeWM & XFCE

Basically, what I customized to my liking into:

- `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua` file
- `~/.themes`
- `~/.icons/` - configured in XFCE's _Appearance_

XFCE specific settings can easily be accessed using `modkey` (Win key by default) + `p` and type _settings manager_ to get it.
